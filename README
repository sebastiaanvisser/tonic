Tonic is an XML and HTML toolkit for Haskell. There are currently many XML
toolkit available for Haskell, unfortunately

Tonic provides:

  - Well thought-out interface:

  - Failsafe: Tonic's parser never fails. When you feed the parser a proper XML
    text the parser will provide you with a proper XML tree. When you feed the
    parser some fuzzy HTML, or some other XML-like dialect that isn't 100%
    valid XML, Tonic will do everything in its power to give you back an XML
    tree that conforms your expectations.

  - Performance: By using a specialized parser monad and only using Data.Text
    as input, Tonic has very fast XML parser. For pretty-printing Tonic uses
    the highly optimized Blaze-Builder package. This builder allows for pretty
    printing large quantities of XML blazingly fast.

  - Filter combinators:

  - Laziness: Both the parser and the filter combinators are lazy. Because the
    parser will never block searching for a closing tag when you are only
    interested in the contents of an element. This way processing small parts
    of a very large XML document becomes very efficient.

  - Generic conversion:
